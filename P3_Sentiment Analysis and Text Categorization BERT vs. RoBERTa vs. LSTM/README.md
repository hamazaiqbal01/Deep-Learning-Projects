This project builds a sentiment analysis system for Roman Urdu text using BERT and RoBERTa transformer models. The system classifies text into positive, negative, or neutral categories, addressing the gap in NLP tools for this widely-used language format.

The implementation involves data preprocessing, model training over 20 epochs, and comprehensive evaluation. BERT achieved 100% training accuracy while RoBERTa maintained 86% evaluation accuracy, demonstrating transformer models can effectively understand Roman Urdu sentiment patterns.

This work has practical applications in social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and regional language processing, showing how modern AI can be adapted for underrepresented languages and cultural contexts.
